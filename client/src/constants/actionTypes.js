 * Action creators are functions that return plain Javascript object of action type and an
 * optional payload. So action creators create actions that are dispatched to the store.
 * They are just pure functions. defines our action types in a file and export them for ease
 * of use in other files. They’re constants and it’s a good practice to define them in a
 * separate file(s).
